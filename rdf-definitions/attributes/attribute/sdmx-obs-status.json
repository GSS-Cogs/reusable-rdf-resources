    "summary": "A code list to mark up statistical observations, missing, imputed, modelled, or otherwise usually footnoted",
    "description": "This code list provides coded information about the \"status\" of an observation (with respect to events such as the ones reflected in the codes composing the code list). The observation status provides information on 1) the quality of a value or 2) unusual or missing values. The codes in this list are known to be heterogeneous, that is they represent different concepts. They are put together in one code list for practical and historical implementation reasons.",

It may also be used in case of experimental data (e.g. in the context of a pilot ahead of a full scale production process) or in case of data of (anticipated/assessed) low quality. If needed, additional information can be provided through free text using the COMMENT_OBS attribute at the observation level or at a higher level. This code is to be used when the estimation is done by a sender agency. When the imputation is carried out by a receiver agency in order to replace or fill gaps in reported data series, the flag to use is I “Value imputed by a receiving agency”."
