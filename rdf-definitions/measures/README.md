**# Reusable Measures**

These hierarchical measures are designed to aide with the comparisons of measures on the hierarchy; it may be inferred that proximity between nodes denotes a form of similarity.

**## Notes on use**

It is suggested that these measures not be used directly, but used as a parent measure for any produced data set. For example, the "Ambulance Response Time" measure should be the parent of the measure contained in a data set called "Northern Ireland Ambulance Response Time by Local Government Area". This allows for another data set such as "England Ambulance Response Times by NHS Trust Area" to have the same parent; however as both children will have differing methods of calculating the response times these two measures are comparable for most purposes so their proximity on the hierarchy allows for comparison between the two measures' observations.
